   <center> <h2>Is Effective Altruism Really Effective?</h2></center>
 <center> <h4>Economic Custodianship over Effective Altruism</h4></center>
  
  <p>A stranger digital acquaintance, once asked me: ”What would you do with a
billion dollars and limited time to invest?”, Lin was an effective altruist from California and was visiting India for her recent FTX-funded project.  Lin seemed curious about an altruistic answer. While I lacked one, I could sense the intent behind her question. We discussed about Economic custodianship, i.e caping down surplus profit in sectors that may seem unethical as businesses with, such as healthcare. with commercialization reserved solely for the purpose of replenishment.</p>
  
  <p>While Lin’s actions lean towards altruism, my thoughts couldn’t fully align with
the idea of fully externally financed charity for a long run. What worse could
happen if the funding were abruptly cut off? Recently FTX, one of the largest
cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, lost all of its value, and it has been quite
challenging for many organizations as FTX went bankrupt, as all the disclosed
donations of around $160 million are at risk of being repaid.</p>
  
  <p>EA in philosophy aims to mitigate world sufferings. It sounds almost unobjectionable. How could you object to altruism? But do we question its effectiveness?
I would be described as a demon if I appeal to portraying EA as ineffective, but my
intent here is not to criticize mass effective altruism. In fact, I support it. But we
need a least futile approach in solving world sufferings.</p>

  <p>Economics operates within a dynamic framework of reward and loss parameters.
In the context of EA, intentionally prioritizing rewards at the expense of altruism
disrupts the cycle of sustaining the economic game frame, lacking the skill for replenishment on the weaker side. The essence of any economic game lies in the utility
function, maximizing utility to address needs and necessities. Amidst losses and rewards, there is an economic decision-making function that optimizes utility—a skill
that must be acquired. Without considering consequences, this function cannot be
effectively optimized, as illustrated in the case of EA.</p>

  <h3>Monoculture</h3>
  <p>EA worldview is the conception of ”good” in contrast to the capitalist/utilitarian
worldview. However, this conception raises questions about its consistency, especially concerning emerging consensus inclinations that may not authentically reflect
genuine needs and necessities but rather follow a trend. Effective altruists might
not be humanistic when it comes to prioritizing genuine needs; instead, they often
adhere to a monoculture that garners significant attention in society.
</p>
  <h3><strong>Constrained Economics</strong></h3>
  <p>It could be a moral dilemma when it comes to Economic Custodianship over Effective Altruism (EA). Would you spend $60 billion on vaccines for immediate impact,
or rather allocate $60 to corporate research to lower costs, ensuring affordability for
everyone in the long run?
EC emphasizes addressing the root cause of necessities without disrupting the
cycle and Nash equilibrium of the economic game frame. Capitalism in EC is
constrained to the needs of replenishment instead of surplus profit. The necessities
are intentionally left unaddressed, requiring self-fulfillment as opposed to being left
unresolved for others to contend with. This re installs the economic feedback loops
and Nash equilibrium. EC worldview emphasizes self-dependency while minimizing
net profit. This ensures an increased flow of utility, thereby easing the necessities.
Ultimately, EC aims to create a more resilient and equitable framework for
navigating the complexities of economics rather than altruism</p>
