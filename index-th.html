  <h3>Dilemma of decisions.</h3>

  <p> Shakespeare's Julius Caesar manifests a classic dilemma of decision making.

The state of Rome, Marullus and Flavius triumphs as Julius Caesar returns from war, Conspirators and his fellow senator Marcus Brutus suspicious of Caesar

accepting offers to become the emperor, plots to assassinate Caesar, Warned of the Ides, 15th of March, Caesar ignores. The consequences of his decisions

can be far-reaching and irreversible. At the capitol Cesar is stabbed by the conspirators followed by Brutus , Julius Caesar enounce his final

words "Et tu, Brute?" (Also you?). His decision collapses the Roman Republic.</p>
  
  
    <h3>The Game</h3>

  <p>The sole intention of the mind is to maximize its utility function, which is the perceived rewards of different outcomes. When an individual consciously or unconsciously takes actions to maximize their utility function, they are said to be engaged in a game. A game is a theoretical framework used to study the decision-making and behavior of rational individuals in strategic situations, and how the interactions between these individuals can lead to specific outcomes. Four key components define the structure and dynamics of a game: the players involved, the rules that govern the game, the strategies (policy) available to the players, and the payoffs or rewards associated with different outcomes.</p>
  

      <h3>Decisions and Consequences</h3>
      <p>1 and 2 are two players, each cell in the table represents possible policies and the consequences of their decisions</p>

<p>
Player A's decision alone can't control the course of the game, A also has no control over the decisions of B. Which establishes a game frame of 4 strategic possibilities.</p>
  
<p>
This is a classic example of a non-cooperative game, where the choice of strategies by either players are ambiguous to each other and thus they are made to act in a dilemma, their actions and payoffs highlight their values in mutual trust and their incentives to act selflessly.</p>
  
    <h3>The Nash Equilibrium.</h3>
  <p>The trail of a game progresses until one achieves their laurels, essentially every game evolves to a state where no one can improve their outcome by changing their strategy unilaterally. A situation where each player's strategy is the best response to the strategies chosen by the other players. At the Nash Equilibrium they both experience the pinnacle of their rewards. </p>
  
    <h3>The Diminishing Utility.</h3>

</div>
  <p>Mortality is inevitable, nothing lasts forever, such is true of every game. The peaks of excitement and the rewards that come with them are fleeting and will eventually die over time. As time passes, the rewards begins to fade and we are left in the reality of diminishing utility.</p>
